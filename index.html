          <p> Leibniz is a hybrid language that mixes English and symbolic expressions. The 
              syntactic structures it includes (assertion, command, and query) and the ASCII representations 
              of math concepts and entities, are what give rise to its impressive express power.
          </p>

          <p> Indeed, if MOOC is to hold on to the promise of democratizing education better than previous 
              hypes, it must SCALE beyond content delivery, in particular in teacher/students interactions. 
              It's a high order, but Leibniz can help -- question asking and teacher style step-by-step 
              solutions are just the tip of the iceberg of what it can offer!

                    We do not have a concrete business model yet, if that is what you are asking. Having that said, however,
                    we do have some ideas on providing learning service to institutions with value-added functionalities such 
                    as homework composing and grading in both standardized forms and simple-structured free forms, in adition 
                    to provide students assistances essentially as 24/7 private tutors, who can answer questions with
                    well defined context using Leibniz. Our service will send notifications to teachers/TAs when Leibniz 
                    fails to give students satisfying answers such that they can get further help. If these type of services 
                    are proved saving time for teachers/TAs and allowing them to spend more time with students face-to-face 
                    in traditional campus, or improving learning experience of students in MOOC setting, there is money to 
                    be earned from these premium services. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    It should be noted that the major advantage of our homework service to other available ones such as 
                    WeBWork and Pearson's MyMathLab is that the problem set composed using Leibniz can generate solutions 
                    in addition to display in natural math notation, which can be pedagogically more valuable than simply 
                    provide an immediate "right/wrong" feedback. As far as grading is concerned, which is in general one 
                    of the most important re-enforcement step in learning and also the most time consuming part of any teaching 
                    (assuming non-standardized form and lecture notes ready) job, the challange and opportunity are equally 
                    abundant.  
                  </p>

                  <p>
	                  just like natural math language, statements defined in Leibniz carry both typesetting info and semantics
                    (it will become clear after you take a look at our demo). Donald Knuth's TeX  
                    language enables typesetting beautiful mathematics, but it does not define any semantics; Namely, it describes 
                    how symbols and operators are placed spatially but does not encode anything about what they actually 
                    mean (he might have wanted semantics, I'd guess). MathML, on the other hand, defines both typesetting 
                    and semantics, but is intended mainly for use by machine since it is an XML-based language. It has gained some 
                    support as a W3 standard from software companies such as Maple Soft and Design Science, and Leibniz is to provide 
                    a translation layer. The general consensus at least for presentation though is that time-tested TeX/Latex 
                    is a more maturer solution (for example, see <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/openmathcrit.pdf"> 
                    a review on OpenMath and MathML here </a>).
                  </p>   

                  <p>
                    Another potential source of revenue is charging technical users who doing routine (not specialized) numerical works on a 
                    daily basis with some visualization and storage support. They can access Leibniz through internet, or if 
                    they have powerful workstations or multi-core machines in their offices, they have the option to install the software 
                    locally and run perhaps from the same browser interface. "Cloud computing" is the current trend, but we see no reason 
                    for people to abondon their computing harware they already have. Users who access Leibniz locally will be required to pay 
                    a traditional software licence fee.

                    Our development is somewhere in between "prototype" and "product", perhaps a little closer to the "product" end. 
                    The project was started in about five and half years ago, although the idea was formed during my graduate years 
                    at USC. Grammar definition of the language is mostly finalized and considerable implementation has been completed, 
                    including core numerical and symbolic libraries, and simple logical programming functionalities that enable 
                    Leibniz to perform mathematical reasoning in the context of single variable calculus within the framework 
                    of First-Order-Logic. To our best knowledge, formal reasoning in calculus by software is something that nobody has 
                    ever tried before despite that reasoning is an essential skill math students are expected to acquire. Our numerical 
                    libraries include commonly used recipes such as fast in-core LU and Cholesky decomposition for large sparse matrices 
                    in C++, and Grand-Canonical-Ensemble Monte-Carlo.

                    There are still many tasks remain to be done -- the libraries as they stand now are quite fragile and incomplete. 
                    The interpreter is mostly written in C++ using Microsoft's compiler, and it will take some efforts to make it cross compile 
                    on Linux if needs to. Taking Dr. Balaji S. Srinivasan's course has been very helpful in introducing us to the 
                    nodejs/express/postgres stack for web application development. <b>Thank you! B.</b> Currently, I am taking 10gen's 
                    MOOC course on mongoDB with nodejs. Has been a very good experience so far, but we are still debating if we should 
                    use mongoDB or traditional SQL for persisting users' documents (problem definitions in Leibniz, solutions in pdf and 
                    html). Please <a href="mailto:rogeryi@comcast.net">email me</a> if you have any opinion on that. 
                  </p>

                    Since we do not have much experience in marketing and sell in the Ed industry (or any industries for that 
                    matter), we will need experienced insiders in the industry to join us when we get funded to help us 
                    <b> become a trusted learning service provider to education institutions in the world </b>, which is 
                    our long term goal. In the mean time, we'd greatly appreciate if you can introduce us to funding sources 
                    and potential collaborators in education institutions. You can reach us at <font color="blue">
                    rogeryi@comcast.net</font>. Thank you in advance for your help!
